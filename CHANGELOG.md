## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Secret store**: PikoCI can store secrets and plain configuration values itself, with no external vault or file on the worker. Secrets are encrypted at rest with an age keypair and masked in build logs; plain values are stored as-is and shown in the clear. Team- and pipeline-scoped with pipeline overriding team, managed via `pikoci client secrets` or the API, and referenced from a pipeline with `secret "pikoci" { key = "..." }`. Entries are stored as secrets by default; `--plain` opts out. Storing a name again replaces its value, so a secret can be rotated without a window in which it does not exist; switching an entry between secret and plain is refused and stays a delete followed by a create. Encryption is optional: without `PIKOCI_SECRET_KEY` the server runs as before and plain values still work ([#667](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/667)).
- **`on_trigger` hook on jobs**: Fire notifications for all transitively reachable jobs before any builds are created, so external systems (e.g. GitHub Checks) see `queued` status immediately when a resource version is triggered ([#528](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/528)).
- **Conditional job execution (`if`/`else_if`/`else`)**: Jobs can use declarative conditional blocks to branch execution based on runtime values (`$GET_*`, `$TASK_*`, `$BUILD_*`, `$INPUT_*`). Supports `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `contains`, `!contains`, `&&`, `||` operators with parentheses. Skipped branches display with a muted badge in the UI ([#164](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/164)).
- **Parameterized manual triggers**: Jobs can declare `input` blocks to collect parameters on manual trigger, injected as `$INPUT_<name>` env vars. Supports typed fields, defaults, dropdowns, and multi-select ([#467](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/467)).
- **`interruptible` on jobs**: When `true`, creating a new build for the job automatically cancels all older running, pending, and waiting-for-approval builds, so only the latest build runs ([#612](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/612)).
- **`allow_failure` on jobs**: When `true`, a failed build is marked as `warning` (salmon) instead of `failed`, unblocking downstream jobs. Any failed build can also be manually marked as warning via a UI button (requires Maintain role) ([#610](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/610)).
- **`disable_retry` on jobs**: Prevents build retries via API and hides the retry button in the UI ([#617](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/617)).
- **Notification integration tests**: Worker-level tests with mock HTTP server verifying notify steps, auto-notification lifecycle filtering (`on`, `jobs`, `exclude`), and message interpolation ([#608](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/608)).

### Changed

- **Build list page load**: `GET /jobs/:name/builds` now omits the `steps` column for list views (returning only id, build_number, status, started_at, duration), reducing a typical 50-build response from ~16MB to ~50KB. Steps are fetched on-demand when a build tab is opened ([#652](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/652)).
- **Pipeline image query**: `image.dot` now uses a lightweight query (`LatestBuildStatusByPipeline`) that selects only `id`, `build_number`, and `status`, cutting response time from 6-8s to under 1s ([#652](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/652)).

### Fixed

- **Server failed to restart with `--pipeline-*` flags**: the startup pipeline seeding always called `CreatePipeline`, so a second boot against a persistent database hit the unique index on `(canonical, team_id)` and the server died after binding its ports. The seeding now looks the pipeline up by canonical name and updates it when it exists, so the flags are idempotent as `docs/Scaling.md` documents. A changed display name is applied on update, a lookup failure other than not-found aborts startup rather than being masked behind the unique-constraint error, and the seeding runs before the embedded worker starts so the worker cannot claim jobs mid-reconcile ([#686](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/686)).
- **Second `get` in a job never resolved**: a build carries the version of the resource whose check produced it, and `buildPullParams` applied that id to every `get` in the plan. For any other resource the lookup searched a different resource's history for an id that could not be there, failing the build with `no version found for resource "..."` — so a job getting two resources could never run, whichever one triggered. The queue's version now applies only to the resource named by `ResourceCanonical`; every other `get` falls through to its latest, as the priority comment already described.
- **Windows startup panic loading embedded templates**: template path lookups now use `path.Join` instead of `filepath.Join`, since `embed.FS` requires forward slashes on every OS ([#641](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/641)).
- **Running step elapsed time not shown**: Steps currently in progress now display a live-updating elapsed timer (matching the format of completed steps), consistent with the global build timer already shown at the top of the page ([#655](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/655)).
- **Services inside `if` branches not stopped**: services started within an `if` branch are now returned to the plan runner and stopped correctly, even when the branch fails ([#664](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/664)).
- **Consecutive `if` blocks merged into one chain**: a second `if` block now starts an independent conditional chain; previously it was treated as a continuation, causing `else`/`else_if` blocks to attach to the wrong `if` ([#664](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/664)).
- **`on_trigger` notify hooks always failing**: `execNotificationCommand` was calling `os.Expand` on shell script args before passing them to `/bin/sh`, pre-expanding shell-assigned variable references (e.g. `$HEAD_SHA`, `$STATUS`) to `""` so all conditions evaluated against empty strings; args are now passed as-is and the shell expands them natively ([#671](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/671)).
- **Route vars clobbered by request body in `createPipeline`, `createPipelineImage`, `createTrigger`**: path variables were assigned before JSON decode; the Go client sends every field without `omitempty`, so empty-string body values overwrote the path values. Fixed by assigning after decode ([#639](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/639)).
- **Condition variable injection**: `$VAR` references are now substituted after the expression is parsed, so a value containing spaces, quotes or operator characters cannot alter the condition logic; malformed conditions (e.g. unsupported operators) are now rejected at pipeline-save time instead of failing at build runtime ([#662](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/662)).
- **`passed` constraint infinite trigger loop**: `checkPassedConstraints` now requests only `succeeded`/`warning` builds, which forces the server to return full step data. Without the status filter the HTTP endpoint returned builds without steps (summary optimisation), making the version intersection always empty — every triggered build was immediately deleted and re-triggered ([#656](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/656)).
- **Concurrency fixes**: `ready_check` now respects build cancellation; API token last-used writes are bounded to 8 goroutines; gRPC server reacts to send errors without waiting for recv; unused `grpcStream` field removed ([#658](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/658)).
- **`for_each` name collision**: expanding a `for_each` job now errors at pipeline-save time if the generated name (e.g. `build--linux`) collides with an explicitly declared job ([#660](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/660)).
- **Non-deterministic job ordering**: job queries now use `ORDER BY order ASC, id ASC` and pipeline scans use `sort.SliceStable`, giving a stable tiebreaker when jobs share the same order value ([#660](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/660)).
- **Input defaults missing on auto-triggered builds**: Worker resource-check triggers now correctly apply declared `input` defaults, so `INPUT_*` env vars are always set even when no values are provided ([#650](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/650)).
- **Build list tabs show stale status**: Build tabs no longer stay stuck on "running" after a build completes — they now refresh automatically when a non-terminal build transitions to a terminal state.
- **Trigger handler authorization bypass**: JSON body could override route vars to trigger jobs in unauthorized teams; body is now decoded before route vars are applied ([#644](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/644)).
- **Active build data overwritten by stale snapshot**: The `onFullBuildFetched` callback now merges only enrichment fields (steps, approvals, version_metadata, pinned_versions) into the polling state rather than replacing the entire build object.
- **Git resource check on empty ref**: `git` resource checks now fail instead of recording an empty-ref version when `ls-remote` finds no ref, which previously triggered builds that failed on checkout ([#676](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/676)).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **JWT session expiration**: Configurable `--session-lifetime` flag (e.g. `24h`, `7d`, `30d`) adds `exp` claim to session tokens. Default `0` preserves current behavior (no expiry) ([#599](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/599)).
- **Password-change session invalidation**: Changing a password (self or admin reset) immediately invalidates all existing sessions for that user via a `token_gen` generation counter ([#599](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/599)).
- **Password strength validation**: Enforce minimum 8-character passwords with inline frontend hints ([#597](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/597)).

### Fixed

- **Build status not updating in UI**: Active build view now detects when a build transitions to a terminal state (succeeded/failed/cancelled) and re-fetches it, instead of requiring a manual page reload.
- **Build polling fan-out CPU spike**: Jobs view now fetches all non-terminal builds in a single `?status=` request instead of one HTTP call per build every 2s. Added in-flight guard and `setTimeout`-based scheduling to `usePolling` to prevent overlapping request storms.
- **N+1 query elimination**: Pipeline image, job list, and resource list endpoints now use batch queries (`FilterByPipeline`, `LatestVersionByResources`, batch serial-group loading) instead of per-item DB calls.

### Changed

- **Role rename**: Viewer→Read, Operator→Write, Maintainer→Maintain to match GitHub's model. DB migration auto-renames stored values. CLI, UI, and docs updated.
- **Modulepreload hints**: Add `<link rel="modulepreload">` for all 27 ES modules, collapsing 4 discovery rounds to 1 parallel fetch ([#575](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/575)).

### Added

- **OIDC/OAuth2 authentication**: Single sign-on with GitHub, Google, GitLab, Keycloak, Microsoft, or any OIDC/OAuth2 provider. Admin UI with provider templates, account linking, and local auth toggle ([#249](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/249)).
- **Secret chaining**: Secret `path`/`key` fields and `secret_type` config can now reference other variables, resolved in dependency order with cycle detection ([#248](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/248)).
- **Approval gates**: `approve` HCL block on jobs creates a human approval gate. Purple "Waiting for Approval" status, approve/reject UI+CLI+API (Maintain+), configurable count, notifications, version pinning, audit events ([#152](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/152)).
- **Version pinning at build creation**: Downstream builds snapshot triggered resource versions at creation time, matching Concourse CI behavior.
- **Audit log**: Append-only team audit trail with 16 event types, filterable UI/CLI/API, cursor-based pagination. Read+ access ([#532](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/532)).
- **Secrets masking in build logs**: Secret values replaced with `***` in stdout/stderr. Real-time and stored output. Skips values < 3 chars ([#147](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/147)).
- **Build report export**: JSON report for any build containing status, steps, logs, approvals, and version data. Available via API (`GET .../builds/{bn}/report`), CLI (`builds report`), and UI Export button. Read+ access ([#531](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/531)).
- **Worker team isolation**: Team-scoped worker tokens restrict workers to their team's builds with automatic global-worker deferral ([#12](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/12), [#98](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/98)).

### Fixed

- `GracefulStop()` hanging indefinitely after SIGQUIT when workers reconnect during drain, leaving the server alive but not accepting connections (502 from reverse proxy) (#572).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Builds stuck in "started" status after server restart (#569). Server now polls DB for running builds during SIGQUIT graceful shutdown (not just embedded workers), recovers orphaned builds on startup, and workers retry build updates with backoff.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- **Frontend migrated from BackboneJS to Preact + HTM**. Replaces Backbone, jQuery, and Underscore (~100KB) with Preact, HTM, preact-router, and @preact/signals (~24KB). No build step, no bundler, same no-npm philosophy. Virtual DOM eliminates flickering from full re-renders. All existing features preserved with 70+ Selenium tests passing.
- CI pipeline restructured: consolidated Go lint/test-mock/test-http into single `go` job, added new `js` job (node:20-slim) for JS linting and unit tests
- Polling now pauses when the browser tab is hidden (Visibility API via `usePolling` hook), reducing wasted network requests by ~50%

### Added

- JavaScript unit tests: 102 tests covering utilities, state management, API layer, hooks, toast system, and component snapshots using Node.js built-in test runner (`node --test`)
- JavaScript linting with oxlint (833 rules, single binary, no npm required)
- `make test-js` and `make lint-js` Makefile targets
- New Selenium tests for build log steps, resource pin/unpin, webhook panel, editor features (vars tab, blocks panel, fullscreen, error diagnostics, graph-node-to-block jump), users CRUD, workers page, pipeline pause/unpause, dark mode persistence, navigation edge cases, and public resource versions access control
- HTTP API integration tests covering all endpoints with real in-memory DB, reorganized `integration/` directory (`integration/selenium/`, `integration/http/`), and new Selenium tests for view switcher, gear/share/resources panels, and version scope banner ([#545](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/545))
- **Version tracking**: Track a specific resource version through the pipeline to see which jobs it passed through and their build status. Available from the resource versions page (Track button), the Resources panel (expandable version list with Track/Trigger/Pin), and a new version dropdown in the list view. When tracking, both graph and list views scope to only the version's path, a banner shows progress, and the URL is shareable via `?version=ID` ([#432](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/432))
- New `GetResourceVersionPath` API endpoint (`GET /teams/{tc}/pipelines/{pc}/resources/{rCan}/versions/{vID}/path`) returns the ordered chain of jobs a version passes through, with build status for each job including retries. Follows version propagation through intermediate put/get resources ([#432](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/432))
- Pipeline graph image endpoint now accepts a `version_id` query parameter to filter the graph to only the tracked version's path with version-specific build colors ([#432](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/432))
- Resource version rows now show a colored status dot indicating the aggregate build status of all jobs that consumed that version ([#534](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/534))
- Pipeline show page now has a "Resources" button that opens a slide-out panel listing all pipeline resources with name, type, latest version, build status, last check time, and a "Check Now" button ([#536](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/536))
- Resource nodes in the pipeline graph view now show a native browser tooltip on hover with the latest version's key-value pairs and aggregate build status ([#537](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/537))
- Pipeline show page now has a **List view** with a [Graph] [Pipeline] [List] view switcher toolbar. The list view shows an execution chain scoped to a selected trigger resource, with jobs displayed in a tree layout reflecting the pipeline DAG. Parallel siblings are grouped under collapsible headers. Clicking a job shows its builds in the right panel (reusing the existing job builds view). A resource selector bar at the top lets you switch between trigger resources and trigger resource checks. View preference, selected resource/job, and collapsed groups persist across reloads ([#538](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/538))
- New `ListPipelineJobs` API endpoint (`GET /teams/{tc}/pipelines/{pc}/jobs`) returns all pipeline jobs enriched with latest build status, running state, build number, duration, and start time. Supports public pipeline fallback ([#538](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/538))
- Pipeline graph view now has a gear icon (⚙) with a "Hide intermediate resources" toggle that removes resource nodes between jobs and draws direct job-to-job edges, keeping only entry-point trigger resources ([#548](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/548), [#539](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/539), [#431](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/431))
- Gear panel now has a "Group parallel jobs" toggle that collapses jobs sharing identical upstream parents into a single compact node with a colored status dot per job and individually clickable rows ([#540](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/540))
- Pipeline graph view now has a share button that opens a panel with copyable SVG, PNG, and Markdown image URLs reflecting the current gear options. List view linear job chains no longer render nested — only parallel groups and fan-in structures create visual nesting ([#517](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/517))

### Fixed

- "Group parallel jobs" now correctly groups root jobs (jobs with no `passed` constraints) that share the same trigger resource, such as parallel CI jobs triggered by the same git resource ([#432](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/432))
- List view: resource selector bar now polls for updates on the same interval as job data, keeping the status dot, latest version, and "checked X ago" timestamp fresh without manual refresh. Updates are applied in-place when the dropdown is open so it stays open ([#558](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/558))
- List view: fan-in jobs (jobs with multiple upstream parents in a parallel group) now render with a left-side bar grouping their parents and the fan-in job indented after the bar, clearly showing the dependency relationship ([#551](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/551))
- Resource versions page: status dots now update in real-time as builds progress, and new versions from "Trigger Resource" appear at the top in correct order with the "latest" badge ([#560](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/560))
- Pipeline toolbar: Resources button and gear icon are now right-aligned, and icon-to-text spacing in toolbar buttons is consistent ([#563](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/563))
- Retrying a build now reuses the resource versions from the original build instead of fetching the latest version ([#552](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/552))
- `in_parallel` sub-step durations now display as formatted time (`HH:MM:SS`) instead of raw nanoseconds ([#526](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/526))
- Webhook triggers now work correctly after the `tags` column was added to resources. `FindByWebhookToken` was missing the `tags` Scan destination, causing all webhook calls to return 400 ([#544](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/544))
- Version tracking banner now adapts to light/dark mode using CSS variables instead of hardcoded dark blue background
- Resources panel close button now renders correctly (Bootstrap Icon instead of raw HTML entity)
- Resources panel version list is now visible to public pipeline viewers (read-only, no trigger/pin buttons)
- Resource panel version text is no longer invisible in light mode (white-on-white)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Worker list now shows full version with commit hash (e.g., `v0.5.0 (abc1234)`) and flags outdated workers with a warning icon and banner when their version+commit doesn't match the server ([#522](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/522))

### Fixed

- Hook steps (`on_success`, `on_failure`, `ensure`) now correctly report their exit code. A failing hook command marks the step as `Failed` in the UI while leaving the overall build status unchanged ([#518](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/518))
- `$PIKOCI_OUTPUT` now works in Docker runner tasks. The host path is remapped to the container workdir (detected via `-w`/`--workdir`) and injected as an `-e` flag during `$env` expansion ([#519](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/519))

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-15

### Refactored

- Consolidate duplicated `clickLink` method from seven Backbone views into a single shared helper in `namespace.js`. Uses `event.target.closest('a')` for safe anchor resolution and adds a null guard for clicks on non-anchor areas ([#447](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/447))

### Fixed

- Persist `runner` override for `notification_type`, `resource_type`, and `secret_type`. The field was parsed from HCL but never saved to the database, silently dropping runner override configuration on reload ([#506](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/506))
- Add missing `hcl:"runner,block"` tag to `Runner` field on `ResourceType`, `SecretType`, `NotificationType`, and `Service` domain types. Built-in HCL definitions decoded directly into these types would silently ignore `runner {}` blocks ([#507](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/507))
- Pipeline updates no longer unpause paused jobs. The `paused` state is now exclusively managed by the dedicated pause/unpause actions, preventing HCL-parsed zero values from overwriting runtime state ([#495](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/495))
- New jobs with `trigger = true` no longer replay the entire version backlog. Jobs now record a `baseline_version_id` at creation time, and the scheduler only considers versions newer than that baseline ([#492](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/492))

### Changed

- Downstream jobs with `passed` constraints are now triggered immediately when upstream builds succeed, instead of waiting for the 10-second scheduler tick. The scheduler remains as a fallback ([#496](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/496))

### Added

- Support referencing specific `for_each` job instances in `passed`, notification `jobs`, and notification `exclude` (e.g., `passed = ["test--a"]`). Also fixes a bug where notification `jobs`/`exclude` with group names never matched `for_each` instance builds at runtime ([#512](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/512))
- Cross-reference validation in `ReadPipeline()`: pipeline saves now catch invalid references to non-existent jobs, resources, runners, notifications, resource types, notification types, and secret types. All errors are reported at once. Also surfaces graph rendering errors in the pipeline editor and show views ([#497](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/497))
- `pipeline validate` CLI command: validate pipeline HCL files for syntax and structural errors without a running server. Supports `--var key=value` and `--vars vars.json` flags. Useful for CI/CD checks, pre-commit hooks, and headless environments ([#155](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/155))
- Release pipeline with .deb/.rpm packages: binaries are now named `pikoci-<os>-<arch>` (with `.exe` for Windows), Linux packages (.deb and .rpm) are generated via nfpm for amd64/arm64, and a SHA256SUMS file is included in GitHub Releases. The release job is split into discrete tasks (install-tools, build-binaries, package-deb-rpm, create-release) with tool caching ([#346](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/346))
- `in_parallel` plan step: run multiple steps concurrently within a job. Supports `limit` (max concurrency) and `fail_fast` (cancel remaining on first failure). Allowed inner step types: `get`, `task`, `put`, `notify`. Nested `in_parallel` and `service` steps are rejected at parse time. Sub-steps stream progress in real-time (CLI and UI), and queued steps show as pending. The UI displays step count on the collapsed header ([#170](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/170))
- Worker tagging: route jobs and resource checks to specific workers using `tags = ["gpu"]` on jobs/resources in the pipeline HCL and `--tags gpu` on workers. Matching uses AND logic (all job tags must be present on the worker). Untagged work runs on any non-exclusive worker. Add `--exclusive-tags` to restrict a worker to only handle matching tagged work. Tags and exclusive status are visible in the workers dashboard. Also fixes resource checks being dispatched to multiple workers simultaneously by adding optimistic locking ([#98](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/98))
- Worker health monitoring: workers send periodic heartbeats to the server, which tracks their status as healthy or stale (no heartbeat for over 90 seconds). Admin users see all workers in a new dashboard with status, queues, platform, version, and uptime. A warning banner appears when no healthy workers are detected. Admins can delete stale workers from the UI or via `DELETE /workers/{name}`. Includes a `pikoci_workers` Prometheus gauge with `status` label for alerting ([#482](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/482))
- Built-in `fs` resource type for watching local files and directories. Triggers jobs when file contents change (SHA256 hash comparison). Supports both single files (with path, hash, modified, size metadata) and directories (tree hash). Use `source = "pikoci://fs"` ([#493](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/493))
- Better error reporting for param typos: pipeline schema validation now catches typos in block names (e.g. `tsk` → `task`) and attributes (e.g. `triggr` → `trigger`, `arg` → `args`) at save time with line-accurate errors and Levenshtein-based suggestions. At runtime, unrecognized resource/notification/service params show warnings in step logs with "did you mean?" hints, and failed commands list available environment variable names to help diagnose missing params ([#116](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/116))
- Documentation: added "Build Logs & Security" section to Pipeline Reference, added job block summary table, added missing sub-block fields to all config tables, fixed mkdocs nav (removed phantom Queue.md, added Pause and Resource Pinning pages). Full docs audit: removed non-existent `secrets` field from step tables, fixed variable types to include `number`/`bool`, fixed secret `path` as optional, added `--var` flag to Variables docs, corrected `$CACHE_DIR` scope to include push, added resource `tags` field, added `setsymmetricdifference` function, updated docker runner example to match actual built-in, fixed Pause.md CLI section ([#502](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/502))

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Runtime variable interpolation in notification messages: `message` fields on `notify` steps and `notification` blocks now expand `$VAR` references at build time (`$BUILD_*`, `$GET_*`, `$TASK_*`). Literal `\n` sequences are converted to real newlines, enabling multiline content like changelogs from `$PIKOCI_OUTPUT` ([#477](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/477))
- `for_each` and `matrix` on jobs: generate multiple job instances from a single definition using `for_each = toset(...)`, `for_each = { key = "value" }`, or `matrix { axis = [...] }`. Each instance gets independent builds, status, and logs. Downstream `passed` constraints automatically fan-in across all instances. Also expands HCL functions to match Terraform (`startswith`, `endswith`, `base64encode`/`decode`, `urlencode`, `timestamp`, `formatdate`, `alltrue`, `anytrue`, `one`, `sum`, `transpose`, `toset`, `setproduct`, `setintersection`, `setunion`, type conversions, and more) ([#193](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/193), [#472](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/472))
- Include resource name in webhook URLs for readability: tokens now use `{canonical}_{uuid}` format instead of bare UUIDs. Old tokens continue to work unchanged ([#470](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/470))
- Add `serial_groups` on jobs for cross-job mutual exclusion ([#186](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/186))
- Step metadata export: get steps auto-forward version metadata to subsequent steps as `GET_<STEPNAME>_<KEY>` env vars, and task steps can write `KEY=VALUE` lines to `$PIKOCI_OUTPUT` to export custom values as `TASK_<STEPNAME>_<KEY>` env vars ([#459](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/459))
- Loading indicators on action buttons: all mutating buttons (trigger, cancel, retry, delete, pause, unpause, pin, etc.) now show a spinner and loading text while the request is in flight, preventing double-clicks and providing visual feedback ([#453](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/453))
- Built-in `shell` runner for simplified shell command execution. Supports inline `cmd` mode (`run "shell" { cmd = "..." }`) and script `file` mode (`run "shell" { file = "script.sh" }`), with optional `shell` param to override the default `/bin/sh` ([#458](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/458))

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Job-level timeout: set `timeout` on a job (e.g. `timeout = "30m"`) to limit total wall-clock time for plan steps. When exceeded the build fails with a "job timed out" error and `on_cancel`/`ensure` hooks still run ([#60](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/60))
- Resource pinning and trigger with specific version: pin a resource to lock the pipeline to a known-good version — the scheduler, worker, and manual job triggers all respect the pin. Trigger downstream jobs with any specific version via the play button. Pinned resources show an amber border in the pipeline graph and a sticky banner on the versions page. Pinning cancels mismatched pending builds. Cron resource GET steps now print the trigger date ([#151](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/151))
- Pause/unpause pipelines and jobs: temporarily stop build triggering without deleting configuration or history. Pausing a pipeline pauses all its jobs; unpausing individual jobs is supported. Resource checks continue running while paused. Paused jobs appear blue in the pipeline graph ([#148](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/148))
- Persistent resource caching: `cache = true` on `resource_type` enables a persistent `$CACHE_DIR` for check and pull scripts, with per-resource override support. The built-in `git` resource type uses caching by default — maintaining a bare clone for faster `git fetch` checks and `--reference-if-able` pulls ([#216](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/216))
- Type-level runner overrides: `resource_type`, `notification_type`, `secret_type`, and `service_type` definitions can specify a `runner` block to override where their exec commands execute, e.g. run inside Docker without modifying the type's command definitions ([#221](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/221))
- Floating toast notifications for success and error feedback on all mutating actions (trigger, delete, retry, cancel, etc.) with auto-dismiss and dark mode support ([#351](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/351))
- File secret type: auto-detect format from file extension (`json`, `yaml`, `env`, `raw`), add `json` and `yaml` as explicit format options, and fix multi-line JSON parsing ([#435](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/435))
- Built-in `artifact` resource type for passing build outputs between jobs using local filesystem storage with content-addressable deduplication, implicit get-after-put for `passed` constraint support, and `$CACHE_DIR` for push steps ([#150](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/150))
- First-class notification entities: `notification_type`, `notification`, and `notify` steps for fire-and-forget notifications with automatic dispatch, job scoping, and `github-check`/`slack`/`discord` notification types ([#154](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/154))
- SVG and PNG pipeline graph formats for embedding in READMEs and dashboards ([#332](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/332))

### Changed

- Removed `.json` URL suffix trick from API endpoints ([#427](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/427))

### Fixed

- After first-login forced password change, user stays on profile page instead of being redirected to the teams page ([#442](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/442))
- Build status transitions not visible in real-time on non-active build tabs in the job builds page ([#444](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/444))
- Toast notifications overlap action buttons on wide screens and cannot be dismissed by clicking ([#443](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/443))
- Job builds view defaults to newest build instead of navigating to the running/pending build ([#441](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/441))
- Pipelines link on team edit page causes full page reload instead of client-side navigation ([#445](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/445))
- Git resource tag mode returns all tags on every check, triggering builds for every historical tag after pipeline recreation ([#419](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/419))
- Pipeline graph shows original build color instead of successful retry when a new build is running ([#421](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/421))
- Pipeline graph shows gray (pending) for jobs with pending + running + succeeded builds instead of the succeeded color ([#429](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/429))

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Local pipeline editor: `pikoci pipeline edit ./file.hcl` opens the browser-based editor for local HCL files with live graph preview and save-to-disk ([#353](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/353))
- `base_url` param for `github-check` resource type to auto-construct a Details link on GitHub check runs from build metadata ([#257](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/257))
- Display current deployed version and commit hash in the web UI header dropdown and via `/version.json` API endpoint ([#392](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/392))
- `--version` CLI flag to print the application version and commit hash ([#392](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/392))
- Docker pull and run instructions in README Quick Start ([#387](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/387))

### Changed

- Refactored frontend JavaScript from a single inline `<script>` block into ES modules under `js/app/` ([#317](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/317))

### Fixed

- Webhook tokens lost on every pipeline update, causing GitHub webhooks to return 400 ([#408](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/408))
- Active build view not refreshing steps and logs during execution ([#411](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/411))
- Scheduler keeps creating pending builds while a build is already running ([#413](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/413))
- Re-enqueue pending builds on server startup so they are not stranded forever ([#399](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/399))
- Error banner persists after backend reconnects: polling successes now clear errors, connection failures show "Connection lost. Retrying...", and polling errors are debounced ([#400](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/400))

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Comprehensive godoc documentation across all packages: package-level comments, exported types, interfaces, functions, methods, and constants ([#395](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/395))
- Go Reference badge on README

### Changed

- Renamed Go module path from `github.com/xescugc/pikoci` to `github.com/pikoci/pikoci` ([#397](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/397))

### Added

- Lazy loading (infinite scroll) for job builds and resource versions: only the newest 50 items load initially, with older items fetched on scroll and new items appearing via polling. CLI backward compatibility preserved with `limit=0`. Cursor-based pagination uses `before`/`after`/`limit` query params with `has_more` metadata ([#345](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/345))

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Documentation site at docs.pikoci.com using MkDocs Material with search, PICO-8 themed light/dark mode, and auto-deploy on master push ([#377](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/377))
- Separate queues for jobs and resource checks: long-running jobs no longer block resource version detection. New `--queues` flag lets operators run dedicated check-only or job-only workers ([#368](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/368))
- User management: Profile page, admin Users page, CLI commands, force password change on default `admin/admin123`, and `--users` flag preserves UI/CLI password changes ([#237](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/237))
- Pipeline graph zoom, pan, and fullscreen controls: scroll-wheel zoom toward cursor, click-drag pan (including on nodes), zoom buttons, reset, fullscreen overlay with navbar visible, pinch-zoom on mobile, and auto-sizing that prevents small pipelines from appearing oversized ([#338](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/338))
- Database export: admin-only `GET /admin/export` endpoint, CLI `pikoci client export -o file.db`, and web UI dropdown button to download the full database as a portable SQLite file ([#275](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/275))

### Fixed

- Drain hanging on SIGQUIT: `Drain()` now cancels the receive context immediately so blocked `Receive()` calls unblock without waiting for the drain timeout ([#390](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/390))
- Documentation: update stale GitHub/Docker URLs to PikoCI org and GHCR, fix outdated claims, add missing docs for `run`, `export`, `pipelines rename`, `on_cancel` hook, and `/metrics` endpoint ([#388](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/388))
- Trigger Resource new version appears at bottom of versions list instead of at top ([#380](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/380))
- SIGQUIT graceful shutdown hanging forever: cancel the main context after workers drain so blocked Receive() calls unblock and the process exits cleanly ([#384](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/384))
- Worker stuck in loop after build cancellation: use parent server context for DB operations so writes survive job cancellation but respect server shutdown ([#382](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/382))
- Follow button: fix race conditions between auto-scroll and scroll listeners, target running step in multi-step builds, and improve visual feedback with "Following"/"Follow" text and solid/outline styles ([#343](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/343))
- Pending builds showing gray on pipeline graph instead of previous build's color with dashed border
- Concurrency re-queuing infinite loop: builds are now created as Pending at trigger time and transitioned to Started atomically by workers, eliminating duplicate build creation from re-queued messages ([#358](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/358), [#246](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/246))
- Resource "Last checked" showing raw duration (e.g., "739760d ago") instead of "never" for resources that have never been checked ([#367](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/367))

### Changed

- CLI outputs JSON instead of Go struct dumps for all commands, making output parseable and pipeable to tools like `jq` ([#360](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/360))
- Make web UI mobile-friendly: viewport meta tag, hamburger menu, responsive CSS for graphs, logs, tables, and touch targets; login page centered without scroll ([#350](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/350))
- Build detail and resource views now show relative timestamps ("5m ago") with absolute time on hover ([#344](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/344))
- Pipeline editor: clicking a block or graph node now scrolls it to the top of the viewport, and resource blocks in the sidebar show `type.label` (e.g., `git.pikoci_pr`) instead of just the type ([#336](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/336))

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- Local pipeline execution: `pikoci run -p pipeline.hcl -j test` runs any job locally without a server. Supports `--resource type.name=path` overrides and `--var key=value` ([#161](https://github.com/PikoCI/pikoci/issues/161))
